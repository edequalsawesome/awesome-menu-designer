## Adding Starter Patterns

You can create custom starter patterns for menu templates to give users quick starting points for their menus. This is especially useful for theme developers who want to provide pre-designed menu layouts.

### How to Add Starter Patterns

1. Create a `/patterns` folder in your theme or plugin directory
2. Add your pattern files (PHP format) to this folder
3. In each pattern file, ensure you include the following in your pattern header:

```php
/**
 * Title: My Mobile Menu Pattern
 * Slug: mytheme/my-mobile-pattern
 * Categories: menu
 * Block Types: core/template-part/menu
 */
```

The key requirement is the `Block Types: core/template-part/menu` line - this ensures your pattern appears as an option when creating new menu template parts.
